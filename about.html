                        Why Recoup?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="lead fw-normal mt-4 ms-4">
                        Most recovery apps focus on social support or maintaining a streak, but Recoup focuses on 
                        organizing information and resources for the individual, giving you more insight and control over 
                        your own journey with guilt-free tools. Our relapse impulse tracker allows individuals to record 
                        an urge to use quickly and discreetly, and presents actionable analytics with the data entered. 
                        The Recoup button is always accessible, so even if the people the consumer trusts are out of 
                        reach, they have effective methods of redirection and grounding themselves at their fingertips. 
                        Between curating a custom Recoup procedure and the amount of information they have the 
                        option to log, individuals are going to get out of it what they put in, but they will never be 
                        punished for not using the app, having the urge to relapse, or physically relapsing. This app is 
                        designed to work in tandem with therapy and social support and fill in the gaps when those 
                        resources aren’t available to give you tools to Recoup whenever you need to.

                    <p class="lead fw-normal mt-4 ms-4">
                        We started with the overall goal to help those currently in substance misuse recovery.
                        Originally, we wanted to create an app that would provide a community for those in recovery and allow them to keep track of their streaks of sobriety. 
                        However, a competitive analysis soon proved that solutions like this already existed on the market. 
                        After several more design discussions and consulting with potential users, an expert in recovery,
                        responses to our survey, and existing research on the subject of recovery, we reached our final 
                        idea: to create an app that allows users to keep track of their more difficult moments in recovery, 
                        so that they can look back on them and discover potential patterns, gain insights, and be more 
                        reflective on their journey. This is a solution that does not yet exist in the world of technological 
                        addiction recovery tools, and we are excited to bring this idea to life. Once we finalized this idea, 
                        we began designing wireframes on Figma to visualize our solution. After getting feedback on 
                        our wireframes, we created our high-fidelity prototype, which you can view <a href="#">here.</a>

                                Users can then choose to journal about this if they would like to record further detail, either at that moment or at the end of the day.

To better visualize the recovery process, this is a transtheoretical model which is a theory in therapy for incorporating new healthier behaviors into people's lives. Notice that this is a circle, showing that its not a straightforward process, including possible ups and downs such as denial, relapse. However, we hope that our app can aid those in stage 3, having the determinism to change, stage 4 deciding to take active change, and stage 5 maintaining the change.

                        Who is Recoup for?

                    <p class="lead fw-normal mt-4 ms-4">
                        Most recovery apps focus on social support or maintaining a streak, but Recoup focuses on 
                        organizing information and resources for the individual, giving you more insight and control over 
                        your own journey with guilt-free tools. Our relapse impulse tracker allows individuals to record 
                        an urge to use quickly and discreetly, and presents actionable analytics with the data entered. 
                        The Recoup button is always accessible, so even if the people the consumer trusts are out of 
                        reach, they have effective methods of redirection and grounding themselves at their fingertips. 
                        Between curating a custom Recoup procedure and the amount of information they have the 
                        option to log, individuals are going to get out of it what they put in, but they will never be 
                        punished for not using the app, having the urge to relapse, or physically relapsing. This app is 
                        designed to work in tandem with therapy and social support and fill in the gaps when those 
                        resources aren’t available to give you tools to Recoup whenever you need to.
