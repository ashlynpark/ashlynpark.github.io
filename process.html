                                To create our solution, we began with a comprehensive competitive analysis of 
                                existing solutions in the market. After identifying a gap in the market, we 
                                conducted academic research to gather information and ensure we had a thorough 
                                understanding of the problem we were trying to solve. The design process was an 
                                iterative one, involving consultation with a potential user at every step. We 
                                designed wireframes on Figma and used them to conduct user research and gathered 
                                feedback from a UCI peer counselor, who was an expert in the field of substance 
                                misuse recovery Finally, we used all of the information we had gathered to create 
                                a high fidelity prototype that fully met the needs of our potential users.

                    <p class="lead fw-normal mt-4 ms-4">
                        Existing wearable solutions for substance misuse recovery include the University of Massachusetts’s (academia) 
                        E4 Empatica wristband device, which tracks users’ general health through heart rate, motion, skin electrical 
                        conductivity, and temperature every 30 seconds. DyAnsys—Drug Relief® is a (industry) device worn behind the ear 
                        that sends electricity in the form of pulses to reduce the feeling of addiction, specifically for opioids and 
                        especially for early withdrawal. Behaivior is a (industry) wearable that can predict and prevent relapses of substanc
                        e abuse by tracking physical conditions and alerting when relapse is about to happen to allow time to intervene. RFID 
                        (radio frequency identification) (industry) technology uses microchips and electromagnetic fields to surveil general 
                        patients by tracking their location and used treatments.

                    <p class="lead fw-normal mt-4 ms-4">
                        Existing website or app solutions include S.A.F.E Alternatives, an online resource website providing a paper control log, 
                        videos, interventions, and tips for ending self abuse. The SoberTool app, which is advertised to stop cravings in the moment, 
                        includes a flow chart of questions leading to different affirmations that do not change and cannot be edited. The I Am Sober 
                        recovery app features daily pledges to be sober, community formation with others in recovery, journal prompts, affirmations, 
                        and sobriety streak tracking. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead fw-normal mt-4 ms-4">    
                        The main gaps are that none of the existing wearable technologies are personally maintained and that the publicly available 
                        apps intended for personal use provide only one template for the multitude of users in recovery. Furthermore, the wearables 
                        rely on collecting physical information, and many apps currently on the market focus on tracking a user’s sobriety as a whole. 
                        Recoup is instead purposed to track the impulses that could lead a user to relapse from their sobriety since emphasizing 
                        sobriety tracking, as many existing apps do, could lead users to feel guilt if they do relapse, with the streak loss 
                        seeming like a punishment. In comparison, our project is geared towards later stages of recovery and allows the user to 
                        have control over their inputs along with other traits such as location and heart rate.

                        In order to better understand our target demographic and their recovery process, we looked into the

                        This journal article, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4553654" target="_blank">Relapse Prevention and the Five Rules of Recovery </a>from YJBM, describes four 
                        main ideas: Relapse is a gradual process with distinct stages; this is a process of great developmental 
                        milestones and personal growth; main tools are mind-body relaxation and cognitive therapy; and “rules” 
                        like being honest with yourself. There are also three stages of relapse. First, individuals experience 
                        emotional relapse where they bottle up feelings, isolate themselves, and poor self-care. Mental relapse 
                        could be the conflict in the mind between using and not using. Physically would be using the substance again.

                        The second journal article is <a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/rehab-guide/relapse-prevention" target="_blank">Relapse 
                        Prevention Strategies & Techniques for Addiction</a> from American Addiction 
                        Centers. This journal article describes the neurological background, for example, how misusing substances can 
                        change neural pathways surrounding memory, decision-making, and rewards. Feeling triggered to use doesn't 
                        necessarily have to be withdrawal symptoms, but maybe also anger, stress, depression, anxiety, peer pressure, 
                        fatigue, loneliness, insomnia, relationship issues, sights, and smell. Finally, the way the individual frames 
                        the situation has an effect too. If a recovering individual gives into a drink at a party and says they're a 
                        failure, it's not good for mental health. Instead, positivity, such as thinking “next time, I'll bring my own 
                        beverages to drink” might help.

                        “mind, body, and spirit”. At the end of the program, participants reported less alcohol cravings, less anxiety, 
                        and less depression. Most of the group also integrated meditation into daily lives or emergencies.

                        Rather than personas, we looked into which part of the recovery process our app helps the most, since 
                        it was not feasible for us to conduct thorough interviews on anyone in recovery as we were creating the 
                        design for our solution. After researching the transtheoretical model of recovery, we determined that our user base 
                        would be those who are in stages 3: having determinism to change, 4: taking active change, and 5: 
                        maintaining the change.

                        including suggestions that we took into consideration. For example, we scrapped our wearable device 
                        idea and that not all of the demographic likes journaling, which we made optional. However, many liked 
                        the customizable aspects of the app, and because many individuals tracked their progress, we emphasized 
                        our mood tracker and impulse tracking features.

                        who shared her knowledge and her own recovery, which gave us many insights to how we could better cater our app. 
                        She approved of our concept and Figma wireframes and gave suggestions like flexible notifications and a resources page.
